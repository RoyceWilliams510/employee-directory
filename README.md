# Employee Tracker

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information presented to them. In the case of this project the main goal is to create a react application that enables companies to view their employees by simple queries.


## Installation

To install this application you must first clone all of the files from this repository down to your local machine. Once that is done you then have to navigate to the application using Bash, and type in the following command once in the root directory of the project:

``
npm install 
``

Once that command is ran you will then have all of the needed packages to run the application installed in your node_modules directory. Now that all of the packages are there, the next step is to simply run this command in the bash (while on the root directory):

``
npm start
``

This will load up the application in browser and you should automatically be directed to it on your default browser once the application has successfully compiled. If that doesn't happen then you should open up your browser and go to localhost:3000 and that's where you should find the application. Enjoy.
